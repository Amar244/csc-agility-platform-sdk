This directory contains 2 scripts to convert the xsd definitions to TypeScript:

list.sh - runs the cxsd.sh on each xsd file
cxsd.sh - runs the cxsd processor on the file passed in (with an echo so you know when there's a missing import)

Install these 2 packages:

$npm install -g http-server
$npm install -g cxsd

See: https://www.npmjs.com/package/cxsd

You will need 2 terminal windows.  In the first one cd to the xsd schema files and server them up:

In this directory:

<git-root-agility-platform-sdk>/agility.api/src/main/resources/schema

Such as:
/Users/mjohnson/git/agility-platform-sdk/agility.api/src/main/resources/schema

Run:

$ sudo http-server

This provides a way to serve up the xsd files. The cxsd tool requires this.


In a separate terminal window:

In this directory (ts) run the converter script:

$ ./converter-script

The resulting defitions will be in this file (relative to the ts directory):

./xmlns/servicemesh.com/agility/api.d.ts
